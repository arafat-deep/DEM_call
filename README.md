# DEM_call
This is a small collection of some scripts for Google Earth Engine that I created. You can use them in the Earth Engine Code Editor or use them in any Javascript IDE using the Earth Engine API. 

There are a few scripts to collect DEMs from various sources just by defining the ROI (Region of Interest).
